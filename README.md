## Roadmap

- Clean up original code of KAMI-Blue, removing unnecessary features. This will see the removal of most combat/anarchy tools, and will generally make the install more lightweight.
- UI Tweaks and cleanups.
- More features aimed at modpack specific tools (perhaps things designed to modify RF, modify things in Tinkers Construct, etc)
